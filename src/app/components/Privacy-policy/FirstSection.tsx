          Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information
          (as described below), Small Screen may disclose Personal Information
          if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a)
          comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants
          served on Small Screen; (b) protect or defend the rights or property
          of Small Screen or users of the Small Screen’s service; or (c) protect
          the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any

          <br></br>Small Screen may disclose and/or transfer personal
          information in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale
          (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession),
          lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition,
          disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of
          Small Screen or of any of the business or assets or shares of Small
          Screen or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive

        <div className={classes.heading}>6. Knowledge and Consent</div>
        <p className={classes.dec}>
          For the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, Small Screen
          collects personal information about you, from you, or from other
          authorized sources, only when you voluntarily provide it or we are
          authorized to collect it. Typically, we will seek consent for the use
          or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection.
          In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information
          has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use
          information for a purpose not previously identified).<br></br>
          <br></br>
          The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is expressed or
          implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal
          information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the
          circumstances.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          As we have described above, we may collect, use or disclose your
          personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are
          permitted or required to do so by applicable law or regulatory
          requirements.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual
          restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your
          consent at any time, please contact us using the contact information
          provided in the “Contacting Us” section of this Privacy Policy. We
          will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service,
          require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of
          information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified
          and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

          If we learn that personally-identifying information has been collected
          from a user under 13 years of age on or through the Website or
